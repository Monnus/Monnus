I am a junior software developer, I am dedicated to growing and developing my skillsüå± .
My journey with Code-Tribe a skills development program taught me to dedicate myself to programing/developing . I have proven to my superiors that I
am a dedicated hard worker and strong-minded individual. I have acquired problem-solving
skillsüõá, I have learned how to develop in different frameworks as Firebase, React and
react-native, and I have developed excellent organisational and time management skills‚è≤. I
have database knowledge and most important data structures and algorithms skills. I also
have the ability to self-train for new projects and technologies.
Short story:


I also created my own website, which was a demo for a hotel web
application adding to it a database using (firebase.js) and design libraries such as( MUI) etc.
Finally, I successfully completed my course at Code-tribe and graduated In November 2022.
The role/positision I am aming for I believe I am a perfect fit because I will ensure digital products
are dependable, a product is properly tested, secure, and have high performance, which
leads to time savings, cost-effectiveness, and customer satisfaction.
I know In the world, there are many that might have a need for these products/ tools, for
example, a charity may need an application for assisting with the raising of funds digitally via
facilitating ticket sales of social events hans companies have a need for a developers who
understands excellent UX designs patters. I am well prepared to extend my services for the
company.
