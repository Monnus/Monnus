## About as a developer üíª
---
I am a junior software developer, I am dedicated to growing and developing my skillsüå± .
I have journeyed with Code-Tribe a skills development program that taught me to dedicate myself to programming/developing. I have proven to my superiors that I
am a dedicated hard worker and strong-minded individual. I have acquired problem-solving
skillsüõá, I have learned how to develop in different frameworks such as Firebase, React and
react-native, and I have developed excellent organisational and time management skills‚è≤. I
have database knowledge and most important data structures and algorithms skills. I also
have the ability to self-train for new projects and technologies.

I also create my own websites, demos or real ones like typical hotel websites to improve my skills as a developer one should, incorporating other technologies like adding to it a database using (firebase.js) and design libraries such as( MUI) etc.
. I have successfully completed my course at Code-tribe and graduated In November 2022.
The role/position I am aiming for I believe I am a perfect fit me perfectly because I will ensure digital products
are dependable, a product is properly tested, secure, and have high performance, which
leads to time savings, cost-effectiveness, and customer satisfaction.
I know In the world, there are many that have a need for these products/ tools, for
example, a charity may need an application for assisting with raising funds digitally
I am well prepared to extend my services to companies having a "customers come first" mindset.
